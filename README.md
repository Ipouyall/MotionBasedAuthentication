# Motion Based Authentication

This project is designed as CA2 of the Cyber Physics Systems at the University of Tehran, Spring 2024.

In this project, we designed a motion based authentication app for mobile devices that is able to set a motion pattern as the answer and requiring to repeat that pattern for authentication.

This project consists of steps below:

- Front-end: mostly developed on QML and is capable of interacting with users. Assigned to **Pouya**
- Back-end: this part is consists of interacting with sensors, noise filtering and the logic of the app. Assigned to **Sina** and **Ali**.
- Analyzing performance: Using tools such as [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) to analysis proposes. Assigned to **Sepehr**
- Documentation and questions: Assigned to all members and it's been done by all of them.
